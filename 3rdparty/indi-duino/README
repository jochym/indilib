indiduino v0.1
==============

This INDI drivers allows to use arduino boards (http://www.arduino.cc)
as general propouse I/O.

The comunication to the arduino board it is made using firmata protocol
(http://www.firmata.org/) and the board has to be load with the standard 
firmata firmaware. This firmware is distributed with the Arduino-IDE 
programing tool. To load File->examples->firmata->standardfirmata

The driver read the properties configuration from xml skeleton file. It use 
also this file to program on runtime arduino pin behaviour (ANALOG,PWM,INPUT, 
OUTPUT). The driver use the property name to map each arduino pin. The syntaxis
is:

DINPUT__xx  -> PIN xx (two digits) is configure as digital input.
DOUTPUT_xx -> PIN xx (two digits) is configure as digital input.
AINPUT__xx  -> PIN xx (two digits) is configure as analog input. Values are report as raw 
              input reading in the 0-1024 range.		 
AOUTPUT_xx -> PIN xx (two digits) is configure as analog output(real PWM). Values are 0-255 
	      range corresponding 0% to 100% PWM duty cycle.	
Advices:

Remember that arduino pins only can driver a litle power. For testing driver leds and buttons are ok. For other device probably you need adicional electronics (relays, MOSFET…)

Assuming your board is arduino-uno o arduino-dumilnove, for analog input (pins labeled A0,A1 .. ) you have to use numbers 14,15 and so on.. (i.e AINPUT__14 is A0, AINPUT__15 is A1 …).

Standard firmata firmware use raw values. Values 0-1023 for analog inputs and 0-256 for analog outputs(PWM). Custom firmaware could change that if needed.See device/firmware/TemplateINDIDUINO.ino

IMPORTANT: The user is responsible to map every pin to the real hardware. No check is done. 

See example skeleton files for more details.
