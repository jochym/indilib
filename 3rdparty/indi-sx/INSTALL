In order to build the INDI qhy5 drivers, you must have:
cmake installed
libusb 0.1.xx (libusb 1.x is not supported) along with the header files (libusb-dev)
INDI installed along with the header files.
cfitsio installed

Run:
cmake .
make
sudo make install

The standalone app can be buit via:
gcc -DQHY5_TEST -Wall -o qhy5 qhy5_driver.c -lusb

This only requires libusb, and not INDI
