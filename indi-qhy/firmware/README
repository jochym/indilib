It must be loaded before you can use the QHY5 camera.

This is done by identifying the qhy5 camera via lsusb:

1) run lsusb

2) identify the camera it has ID 1618:0901 and find the bus and device:
Bus 008 Device 093: ID 1618:0901

3) load the bootloader via fxload
	fxload -t fx2 -I qhy5loader.hex -D /dev/bus/usb/008/093

4) load the firmware
	fxload -t fx2 -I qhy5.hex -D /dev/bus/usb/008/093

5) verify that the camera has initialized via lsusb (ID: 16c0:296d)
Bus 008 Device 094: ID 16c0:296d 

Also included is a udev control file courtesy of Clive Rogers.
install in your udev dir (usually /etc/udev/rules.d)
and copy the 2 hex files to /lib/firmware
The camera should be auto-detected when plugged in, and the firmware automatically loaded
