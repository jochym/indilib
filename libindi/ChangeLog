From 0.5 to 0.6

        # Devices:
                + Astrophysics mount is now working.
                + Apogee driver is now working.
        # Features:
                + New libindi structure to streamline development.
                + Drivers using Standard Property _REQUEST WO to make requests. This facilitates scripting and automation of drivers.

From 0.4 to 0.5

	# Devices:
		+ True Technology Filter Wheel
		+ SBIG STV

	# Features:
	     + Added INDI Observer pattern to enable flexible inter-driver communication.
             + getINDI now supports BLOBs.
	     + LX200 Drivers use client timestamp to update the telescope internal clock. The old behavior was to use to system's time.
	     + Added a new INDI Standard Property: UTC_OFFSET.
	     + Dropping threaded INDI server in favor of the slightly better non-threaded version due to performance considerations.

	# Bugs
	     + SBIG CCD driver was updated to fix problems with CFITSIO.
	     + Updated TTY API to include error reporting, in addition to fixing a few bugs.
	     + Fixed INDI Mac OSX Crash.

	# Known Issues
	     + Astrophysics Mount driver (apmount) is not working. It is currently under new development and is intented to be released in the next version as it matures.
             + Meade LPI exposure is locked to 1 second. The Video4Linux support for timed exposures is limited. A fix should be available in the next release.
             + The SBIG driver does not allow autoguiding. When one selects the guider CCD, any exposure on the imaging CCD is cancelled and vice-versa.
