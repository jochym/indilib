*************************************************
* INDI Developers Manual
* Chapter 8: Tutorial
**************************************************

Introduction
--------------

The tutorials included in the INDI Library can be used with any INDI compatible client. The following instructions are provided to test the drivers with KStars. If you are running a different client, refer to your client documentation.

Tutorials
----------

Four tutorials are presented to introduce developers to the INDI architecture. 

tutorial_one: We construct a most basic (and useless) device driver to illustate basic INDI structures.
tutorial_two:  We create a simple simulator. We will use a few handy utility functions provided by INDI like timers, string <---> number conversion, and more.
tutorial_three:  We create a simple device, and establish a data channel with the client to transmit a FITS file. 

tutorial_dome and tutorial_rain are part of the inter-driver communication tutorial. 

Usage
--------

1. Running cmake in the libindi directory should build the examples binary as well.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Run KStars (v1.1 or above is required)

Under KStars, click on the "device" menu, then click on the "device manager". Click on the "client" tab and then click on the "add" button.

A dialog box will be displayed with three fields: name, host, and port. 

You can enter anything in the name field, for example "my device" or "tutorial". 

Enter "127.0.0.1" in the host name and "8000" in the port entry (without the quotes). This device will be saved in your client menu. So you only to do #2 once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. In the src/examples directory, run each tutorial 

$ indiserver -v -p 8000 ./tutorial_NUM

where num is the tutorial number (tutorial_one, tutorial_two, or tutorial_three).

For the inter-driver communications tutorial, type instead:

$ indiserver -v -p 8000 ./tutorial_dome ./tutorial_rain

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. In KStars, go the device menu --> device manager --> client and select the host you added in step #2 and hit connect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. The connection icon should be changed to connected, otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Close the device manager, and open the INDI Control Panel in the device menu. You can control your device from there.
